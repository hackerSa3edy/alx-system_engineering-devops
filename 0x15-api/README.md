# Project: 0x15. API

## Description

This project focuses on understanding and working with APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). APIs allow different software systems to communicate with each other. This project provides hands-on experience with making API requests, handling responses, and working with data formats such as JSON and CSV.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to execute the scripts.
- Test the scripts in a safe environment to avoid any unintended changes to your system.
- Refer to the resources provided for a deeper understanding of each concept and its practical applications.
- Regularly review and update your scripts to maintain compatibility with the latest API changes.
