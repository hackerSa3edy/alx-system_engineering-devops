# Project: 0x07. Networking Basics #0

## Description

This directory contains a series of scripts that demonstrate fundamental networking concepts and operations. These scripts are designed to help users understand and practice basic networking tasks, including understanding the OSI model, different types of networks, IP addressing, and common networking protocols.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to execute the scripts.
- Test the scripts in a safe environment to avoid any unintended changes to your system.
- Refer to the resources provided for a deeper understanding of each concept and its practical applications.
