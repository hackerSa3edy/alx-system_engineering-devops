# Project: Attack is the Best Defense

## Description

This project focuses on understanding and implementing various network security attack techniques and defenses. The goal is to provide hands-on experience with network sniffing, ARP spoofing, and dictionary attacks, as well as to understand the importance of securing network communications and services.

## Learning Objectives

### General

- Understand the basics of network sniffing and how it can be used to intercept network traffic
- Learn about ARP spoofing and how it can be used to intercept and modify network traffic
- Understand how to connect to an SMTP relay using telnet
- Learn about Docker and its uses in modern software development and deployment
- Understand what a dictionary attack is and how it can be used to crack passwords

## Tasks

| Task                                             | Description                                                                                     | File                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 0. ARP spoofing and sniffing unencrypted traffic | Write a script that performs ARP spoofing and network sniffing to intercept unencrypted traffic | [0-sniffing](./0-sniffing)                   |
| 1. Dictionary attack                             | Write a script that performs a dictionary attack to crack passwords                             | [1-dictionary_attack](./1-dictionary_attack) |

## Additional Notes

- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to execute the scripts.
- Test the scripts in a safe environment to avoid any unintended changes to your system or network.
- Refer to the resources provided for a deeper understanding of each concept and its practical applications.
- Regularly review and update your security practices to protect against these types of attacks.
